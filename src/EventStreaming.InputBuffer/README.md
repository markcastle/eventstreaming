# EventStreaming.InputBuffer

Generic Input Buffer & Event Receiver abstractions for EventStreaming.

- **IInputBuffer<T>:** Generic, thread-safe buffer for ingesting events from any source.
- **IEventReceiver<T>:** Interface for pluggable event sources.

See the EPIC proposal and TASK.md for design goals and implementation steps.
