# EPIC Proposal: Generic Input Buffer & Event Receiver Framework

## Overview
This EPIC proposes the design and implementation of a **Generic Input Buffer & Event Receiver Framework** for the EventStreaming library. The goal is to provide a highly flexible, reusable, and extensible mechanism for ingesting events from any source (user input, network, files, sensors, APIs, etc.), buffering them, and dispatching them for processing. This will empower developers to build robust event-driven systems for a wide variety of domains with minimal boilerplate.

## Key Features
- **Generic Input Buffer:** Accepts any event type, supports batching, deduplication, filtering, and backpressure.
- **Pluggable Event Receivers:** Easily connect to different input sources (e.g., HTTP, WebSocket, file, UI, message queues).
- **Extensible Middleware Pipeline:** Allow pre-processing, validation, transformation, or enrichment of incoming events.
- **Thread-safe and High-Performance:** Built on top of proven concurrent primitives.
- **Observability:** Hooks for logging, metrics, and tracing event flow.
- **Integration Ready:** Works seamlessly with the existing buffering, event primitives, and processing pipeline.

## Example Use Cases
- Game engines: Buffering player input, AI events, or network messages.
- Distributed systems: Ingesting events from message brokers or APIs.
- UI applications: Handling user gestures, commands, or sensor data.
- IoT: Buffering telemetry or control signals from devices.

## Proposed Architecture
- **IInputBuffer<T>:** Abstraction for any input buffer.
- **InputBuffer<T>:** Default implementation with plug-in middleware and event receivers.
- **IEventReceiver<T>:** Interface for receiving events from any source.
- **Middleware Pipeline:** Chain of delegates for event pre-processing.
- **DI/Registration Extensions:** Easy integration into .NET DI and app startup.

## Deliverables
- Core abstractions and interfaces
- Reference implementation(s)
- Example receivers (timer, in-memory, mock, etc.)
- Unit and integration tests
- Documentation and usage examples

---

## Benefits
- Dramatically reduces boilerplate for event ingestion
- Promotes best practices for event-driven architectures
- Makes EventStreaming suitable for a wider range of real-world scenarios
- Ensures consistency and testability across all event sources

---

## Next Steps
- Design interfaces and extension methods
- Implement core components
- Create sample receivers and usage examples
- Document and test thoroughly
